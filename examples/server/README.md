`RuleGo-Server` is a ready-to-use standalone rule engine service, and this project is also a scaffold for developing RuleGo applications. You can perform secondary development based on this project, or you can directly download the executable [binary files](https://github.com/yunboom/rulego/releases).

Visual Editor:[RuleGo-Editor](https://editor.rulego.cc/), configure the HTTP API of this project to manage and debug rule chains.

## Features
- A ready-to-use rule engine service that runs independently based on RuleGo

- Automatically scans components and component forms for use by the editor
- Supports visual management, debugging, deployment, and providing APIs for executing rule chains
- Supports RuleGo-Editor for visual front-end
- Simple deployment, ready to use, no database required
- Lightweight, low memory usage, high performance
- Automatically registers all components and rule chains as MCP tools for AI assistants to call. For details: [rulego-server-mcp](https://rulego.cc/en/pages/rulego-server-mcp/)

## HTTP API

[API Doc](https://apifox.com/apidoc/shared-d17a63fe-2201-4e37-89fb-f2e8c1cbaf40/234016936e0)

* Get all component lists
  - GET /api/v1/components

* Execute the rule chain and get the execution result API
  - POST /api/v1/rules/:chainId/execute/:msgType
  - chainId: The rule chain ID that processes the data
  - msgType: Message type
  - body: Message body

* Report data to the rule chain API, without focusing on the execution result
  - POST /api/v1/rules/:chainId/notify/:msgType
  - chainId: The rule chain ID that processes the data
  - msgType: Message type
  - body: Message body

* Query rule chain
  - GET /api/v1/rules/{chainId}/{nodeId}
  - chainId: Rule chain ID
  - nodeId: If empty, query the rule chain definition; otherwise, query the specified node ID in the rule chain

* Save or update rule chain
  - POST /api/v1/rules/{chainId}
  - chainId: Rule chain ID
  - nodeId: If empty, update the rule chain definition; otherwise, update the specified node ID in the rule chain
  - body: Update content

* Save rule chain Configuration
  - POST /api/v1/rules/:chainId/config/:varType
  - chainId: Rule chain ID
  - varType: vars/secrets
  - body: Configuration content

* Get node debugging log API
  - Get /api/v1/logs/debug?&chainId={chainId}&nodeId={nodeId}
  - chainId: Rule chain ID
  - nodeId: Node ID

  When the node's debugMode is turned on, debugging logs will be recorded. Currently, this interface's logs are stored in memory, with each node saving the latest 40 entries. If historical data is needed, please implement an interface to store it in the database.

## Multi-Tenancy/Multi-User

This project supports multi-tenancy/multi-user, with each user's rule chain data being isolated. User data is stored in the `data/workflows/{username}` directory.

User permission verification is disabled by default, and all operations are performed as the default user. To enable permission verification:

- Obtain a token using a username and password, and then access other interfaces using the token. Example:
```ini
# Whether the API requires JWT authentication; if disabled, operations will be performed as the default user (admin)
require_auth = true
# JWT secret key
jwt_secret_key = r6G7qZ8xk9P0y1Q2w3E4r5T6y7U8i9O0pL7z8x9CvBnM3k2l1
# JWT expiration time (in milliseconds)
jwt_expire_time = 43200000
# JWT issuer
jwt_issuer = rulego.cc
# User list
# Configure usernames and passwords in the format username=password[,apiKey], where apiKey is optional.
# If apiKey is configured, the caller can access other interfaces directly using the apiKey without logging in.
[users]
admin = admin
user01 = user01
```
The frontend obtains a token through the login interface (`/api/v1/login`) and then accesses other interfaces using the token. Example:
```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer token" http://localhost:8080/api/resource
```

- Access other interfaces using the `api_key` method. Example:
```ini
# Whether the API requires JWT authentication; if disabled, operations will be performed as the default user (admin)
require_auth = true
# User list
# Configure usernames and passwords in the format username=password[,apiKey], where apiKey is optional.
# If apiKey is configured, the caller can access other interfaces directly using the apiKey without logging in.
[users]
admin = admin,2af255ea-5618-467d-914c-67a8beeca31d
user01 = user01
```
Then access other interfaces using the token. Example:
```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer apiKey" http://localhost:8080/api/resource
```

## server compilation

To save the size of the compiled file, the extension component [rulego-components](https://github.com/yunboom/rulego-components) is not included by default. Compile with the default setting:

```shell
cd cmd/server
go build .
```

If you need to include the extension component [rulego-components](https://github.com/yunboom/rulego-components), compile with the `with_extend` tag:

```shell
cd cmd/server
go build -tags with_extend .
```
Other extension component library tags:
- To register the extension component [rulego-components](https://github.com/yunboom/rulego-components), compile with the `with_extend` tag.
- To register the AI extension component [rulego-components-ai](https://github.com/yunboom/rulego-components-ai), compile with the `with_ai` tag.
- To register the CI/CD extension component [rulego-components-ci](https://github.com/yunboom/rulego-components-ci), compile with the `with_ci` tag.
- To register the IoT extension component [rulego-components-iot](https://github.com/yunboom/rulego-components-iot), compile with the `with_iot` tag.
- To register the ETL extension component [rulego-components-etl](https://github.com/yunboom/rulego-components-etl), compile with the `with_etl` tag.
- Replace the standard `endpoint/http` and `restApiCall` components with `fasthttp`, and compile with the `use_fasthttp` tag.

If you need to include multiple extension component libraries at the same time, you can compile with the `go build -tags "with_extend,with_ai,with_ci,with_iot,with_etl,use_fasthttp" .` tag.

## server startup

```shell
./server -c="./config.conf"
```

Start in the background

```shell
nohup ./server -c="./config.conf" >> console.log &
```
## RuleGo-Editor
RuleGo-Editor is the UI interface of RuleGo-Server, which allows for the visual management, debugging, and deployment of rule chains.

Usage steps:
- Unzip the downloaded `editor.zip` to the current directory and visit `http://localhost:9090/` in your browser to access RuleGo-Editor.
- - The directory for rulego-editor can be modified by configuring the `resource_mapping` in `config.conf`.
- The backend API address for rulego-editor can be modified by configuring the `baseUrl` in `editor/config/config.js`.

## RuleGo-Server-MCP
RuleGo-Server supports MCP (Model Context Protocol). Once enabled, the system automatically registers all components, rule chains, and APIs as MCP tools. This allows AI assistants (such as Windsurf, Cursor, Codeium, etc.) to directly call these tools via the MCP protocol, enabling deep integration with application systems.
