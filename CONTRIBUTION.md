## 2. Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing an open and inclusive community environment. Please adhere to our [Code of Conduct] when participating in this project.

## 3. Submitting Issues/Handling Issue Tasks

- **Submit Issue**: Submit bug reports, feature requests, or suggestions in the [Github Issues](https://github.com/yunboom/rulego/issues) .
- **Participate in Discussions**: Join the discussion of existing Issues and share your thoughts and feedback.
- **Claim an Issue**: If you are willing to work on an Issue, assign it to yourself by commenting `/assign @yourself`.

## 4. Contributing Source Code

### 4.1 Detailed Steps for Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Check Existing PRs**: Search for related PRs in [Github Pull Requests](https://github.com/yunboom/rulego/pulls) to avoid duplicate work.
2. **Discuss Design**: Discussing your design before submitting a PR can help ensure that your work meets the project's requirements.
3. **Sign DCO**: Ensure each commit is signed with [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) using `git commit -s`.
4. **Fork the Repository**: Fork and clone the rulego/rulego repository on Github.
5. **Create a Branch**: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch main`.
6. **Write Code and Tests**: Add your code and corresponding test cases.
7. **Format Code**: Format your code using the `gofmt -s -w .` command.
8. **Commit the code**: Use `git add .` and `git commit -s -m "fix: add new feature"` to commit the changes.
    - `feat`: Abbreviation for feature, a new functionality or enhancement.
    - `fix`: Bug fix.
    - `docs`: Documentation changes.
    - `style`: Formatting changes. For example, adjusting indentation, spaces, removing extra blank lines, or adding missing semicolons. In short, changes that do not affect the meaning or functionality of the code.
    - `refactor`: Code refactoring. Modifications that are neither bug fixes nor new feature additions.
    - `perf`: Abbreviation for performance, improvements to code performance.
    - `test`: Changes to test files.
    - `chore`: Other minor changes. Typically one or two lines of changes, or a series of small changes that belong to this category.

   For more detailed information, please refer to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/zh-hans/v1.0.0/).

9. **Push the code**: Before committing the code, please first perform a rebase operation to ensure that your branch is synchronized with the main branch of the upstream repository. 
   - `git fetch --all`
   - `git rebase upstream/main`
   - Push your branch to GitHub: `git push origin my-fix-branch`
10. **Create a PR**: Create a PR on Github and ensure you fill in a detailed PR description.
